# This script is a createContainer hook [1] that replicates the functionality from entrypoint script to mount product_name and product_uuid but from a product_name and product_uuid copied into the contianer rootfs to prevent all the containers from bind mounting the same file. Sharing the same bind mount between all the containers increases the latency accessing the container, preventing it from accessing in some cases.
